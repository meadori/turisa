# turisa

`turisa` is a virtual Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) for a single-tape Turing machine.

The goals of this project are to:

- Define a virtual [Instruction Set Architecture](doc/isa.md) (ISA) for a single-type Turing machine.
- Define an [ABI](doc/abi.md) for building tools with the ISA.
- An assembler, disassembler, and virtual machine for writing and executing `turisa` programs.
